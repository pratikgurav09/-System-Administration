Disk Partitioning is the process of dividing a disk into one or more logical areas, often known as partitions, on which the user can work 
separately. It is one step of disk formatting. If a partition is created, the disk will store the information about the location and size 
of partitions in the partition table. With the partition table, each partition can appear to the operating system as a logical disk, and 
users can read and write data on those disks. The main advantage of disk partitioning is that each partition can be managed separately.

-A partition table tells the operating system how the partitions and data on the drive are organized. For example, the screenshots above 
 show the partition tables on the drive, and each individual partition is shown as a rectangular block.
-There are two main types of partition tables: MBR and GPT.
-MBR stands for Master Boot Record, and is a bit of reserved space at the beginning of the drive that contains the information about how 
 the partitions are organized. The MBR also contains code to launch the operating system, and it's sometimes called the Boot Loader.
-GPT is an abbreviation of GUID Partition Table, and is a newer standard that's slowly replacing MBR.
-Unlike an MBR partition table, GPT stores the data about how all the partitions are organized and how to boot the OS throughout the
 drive. That way if one partition is erased or corrupted, it's still possible to boot and recover some of the data.
-If you bought your computer within the last five years or so, it's very likely that it's using GPT partition tables rather than the older
 MBR tables.

Steps to create a partition
1. List partitions
2. Label a partition
3. Use mkpart to make a partition
4. Let the partition be created/settled
5. Attach the file system to the partition
6. Create a mount point directory
7. Add entry in fstab
8. Systemctl daemon-reload
9. Mount the partition on the directory
10. Reboot
