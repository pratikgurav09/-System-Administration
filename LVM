LVM (Logical Volume Manager) â€“ Logical Volume Manager manages disk drives and any other storage device. The logical volume manager 
allows you to resize your partitions without having to modify the partition table on your hard disk. This is important when you want 
to expand a new disk partition versus migrating all or part of the file system to a new disk.

1.Physical volume (PV): A physical volume is another name for a regular physical disk partition that is used or will be used by LVM.
2.Volume Group (VG): Any no. of physical volume on different disk drives can be added together into a volume group.
3.Logical volume (LV): Volume groups must then be subdivided into logical volumes. Each logical volume can be individually formatted as 
if it were a regular Linux partition. A logical volume is therefore like a virtual partition on your virtual disk drive.
