Links and types:
There are two types of links:
1. Hard links
2. Soft links (Symbolic links)

Hard link:
Hard links acts like a mirror copy of the original file. These links share the same incode. It accesses the data available in the original file.
If the earlier selected file is deleted, the hard link to the file will still contain the data of that file. Changes made to the original or
hard-linked file will reflect in the other. The size of the hard link file is same as the original file. It has the actual content of the
original file, so that you can view the content, even if the original file moved or removed. Hard links are comparitively faster than soft link.
Command for hard link is-
$ ln [original file name] [Link name]

Soft link:
Soft link (also known as Symbolic link) is an actual link to the original file also know as symbolic link or symlinks. It does not access the data
available in the original file. Soft links are comparatively slower. The soft links points to the original file so if the original file is deleted
then the soft link fails. Soft link contains the path for original file and not the content. The size of the soft link is equal to the name of the
file for which the soft link is created. If you delete soft link nothing will happen to the original file. The reason for this is, the actual file
or directory’s incode is different from the soft link created file’s incode. 
$ ln -s [Original file name] [Link name]
