Package management is a method of installing and maintaining (which includes updating and probably removing as well) software on 
the system.

Programs were only distributed as source code, along with the required man pages, the necessary configuration 
files, and more. Nowadays, most Linux distributors use by default pre-built programs or sets of programs called packages, which are 
presented to users ready for installation on that distribution. However, one of the wonders of Linux is still the possibility to obtain 
source code of a program to be studied, improved, and compiled.

//Package Manager

2.Install a package:  yum install PACKAGENAME 
3.Update all PAckage: yum update
4.Remove a package: yum remove PACKAGENAME
5.To view transaction history: yum remove PACKAGENAME
6.To reverse a transaction: yum history undo INDEXNUMBER

//Yum Repository
1.File must exist in the /etc/yum.repos.d/ directory
2.File must have an extension .repo
3.If GPG check is enabled then GPG key must be mentioned


//How package management systems work
If a certain package requires a certain resource such as a shared library, or another package, it is said to have a dependency. All
modern package management systems provide some method of dependency resolution to ensure that when a package is installed, all of its 
dependencies are installed as well.
